    <h1 class="Kouzan">She wakes up in an overgrown shack where she can only assume is deeper in the woods.</h1>
        <p class="yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke">Waking up in a haze, her vision begins coming to as she examines the dense foliage and the moldy growth of the structure she is in. Slowly raising herself off the ground she sees a hall to her side, a portion of the house ahead missing, through it is just<br>wilderness as far as she can see.</p>
         <p class="Yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke">She checks herself, she still has her bag but all thats in it now is the key to the house, a key she doesn't even recognize, and her fathers book. She's covered in scratches,<br>her clothes worn and frayed as if she had been drug for miles.

         <p class="yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke">After a brief look around it seems like theres not going to be any clues around here,<br>the whole house is just a relic swallowed by dirt and fungus.<br>a few frail pieces of empty furniture lay about and With the smell of it all actually starting to sting her nose, the only option is to wander out and see<br>if theres any sign where she could even be.</p>
