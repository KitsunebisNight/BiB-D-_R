    <h1 class="Kouzan">The seemingly endless woods grow foggy as the light of day prepares to fade away.</h1>
         <p class="yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke">Wandering, lost in time, she has no idea how far shes come and theres no way to tell what direction she faces. Any sign of life she passes by is merely a remnant that was. Sounds other than her own breath, her own feet, begin to fade out<br>as the feeling of isolation grows.</p>
            <p class="yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke">Figuring out where she was became nothing but another memory as she began to wonder;<br>is there any sign of life even out here?<br>She is lost in the woods, she wouldn't be getting anywhere soon.

         <p class="Yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke">The sun now breaking away, she stumbles upon a small pond with a sturdy enough fishing hut sat atop a mound at its side. There is a light out front but still there<br>is no sign of life occupying the hut.</p>
         <p class="Yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke">She has no alternatives, it's got a small wood burning stove and a stable floor.<br>This is where she stops for the time being.<br>At least now she can take some time to gather her thoughts.</p>

         <p class="Yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke">Her only connection to the outside now seems to be her fathers book and key, she can study his notes and try to find some kind of lead to follow. And maybe read some of her childhood stories just to stay sane.</p>
         <p class="Kouzan" style="color:whitesmoke">But as far as shes concerned right now,<br>this is only her first night out.<br>Goodnight. <em>Good luck.</em></p>
