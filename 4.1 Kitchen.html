         She rummages through the old shelves, she's looking for a particular book. She stops and idles for a moment as she reminisces on the home cooked meals of her childhood.</p>
         <p class="Yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke"> There should be a note for her, though likely not in the kitchen; she remembers something, her father used to tell her stories from a particular book over dinner. It was his favorite book, he always kept it in <em>his office</em> upstairs.</p>
         <p class="Yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke">
         At a side glance as she leaves the room, she notices a peculiar shelf, there are some perfectly healthy apples. Strange.</p>
