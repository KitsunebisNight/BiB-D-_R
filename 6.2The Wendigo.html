    <h1 class="Kouzan">A creature sits in the middle of the room,<br>patiently waiting for you to approach.</h1>
         <p class="yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke"></p>
         <p class="yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke">She is immediately hit with a paralyzing shock. Speechless, she examines the creature ahead of her. Antlers, the head of a disfigured deer,<br>other than that almost humanoid in figure, squatting on all fours, eyes locked on her.
         </p>
         <p class="Yomogi" style="color:whitesmoke">She scans the form of the creature a few times before she passes eye contact. Immediately it makes her feel uneasy, nauseous, and then drowsy. It doesn't move, huffing<br>under its breath as it watches her.
